**This project is far from done and is under active development! If you consider to clone this repository anyway please don't hate on us ^^**
# DocSort
Scan any documents, store them in an encrypted vault, access them everywhere and find them physically.

Build with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and much <span style="color: red;">*♥*</span>.

## Feature list
This is what we planned for this project to build in:
* Secure and encrypted way to store important documents
* Simple and modern UI (built with Angular and Electron)
* Separate Backend & Frontend to enable Self-Hostable server to access your documents everywhere without payable service
* Everything is free, except donations (only If you want)
* Own android app to add and read documents
* Multi-Platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Portable version should be available
* Multi-User support (like I said, own server)
* Scan document content with OCR *and later with an AI maybe*
* Documents can be tagged
* Intelligent search that combines document content, tags, title and description
* Fully Open-Source without any malicious or spying code
* Create backups in your Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or on own storage device
