* Own android app to add and read documents
* Multi-Platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Portable version should be available
* Multi-User support (like I said, own server)
* Scan document content with OCR *and later with an AI maybe*
* Documents can be tagged
* Intelligent search that combines document content, tags, title and description
* Fully Open-Source without any malicious code
* No costs everything is free, except donations (only If you want)
